* TODO Lock cursor to window
a way to lock the cursor to a window in the current tag
so that the cursor can't exit the window geometry,
change the border of the locked window to red or whatever.
Each tag can have only one locked window,
When switching tag if there is a locked window in the tag you are goint to,
make sure the cursor warps at the center of the locked window automatically.
